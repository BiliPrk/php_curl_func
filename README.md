# Complete curl function running on PHP

![The picture comes from the Internet](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/BiliPrk/assets/other/php-curl-tutorial.jpg)

## Project information

Latest Version: `V1.0.1`  
Still Updating: `True`  
Perfectly Adapted PHP Version: `7.4`  

## Development Reasons

In the PHP application we developed, if we use the `file_get_contents` function that comes with PHP for the part involving network requests, the scalability and efficiency R not high. In my recent projects, there R many parts that rely on network requests. I have to construct different cUrl for each of them, which is very tiring at this time! So I will continue to update the same cUrl function, which is convenient for myself and others!

## Tips

The early versions may be immature and will be mainly updated later! The version of PHP is also being updated, as is the network security aspect! This project will continue to be updated over time! If there is a problem, U can go to the "[Issues](https://github.com/BiliPrk/php_curl_func/issues)" of the project to stay.

## Words to Friends from PRC

If U happen to be a friend from mainland PRC, and U don't have access to GitHub, which is blocked by the Chinese Gov, but U still want to get updates, then I think U may need some special means of accessing the Internet or go to [my Chinese blog](https://www.cprk.cc/) to download.
