# Complete curl function running on PHP

![The picture comes from the Internet](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/BiliPrk/assets/other/php-curl-tutorial.jpg)

## Project information

Latest Version: `V1.0.1`  
Still Updating: `True`  
Perfectly Adapted PHP Version: `7.4`  

> Since PHP can provide a lot of cUrl opts, I will find a way to ena all opts in later vers. Not all opts are currently supported. And adapt to all vers of PHP.

## Development Reasons

In the PHP application we developed, if we use the `file_get_contents` function that comes with PHP for the part involving network requests, the scalability and efficiency R not high. In my recent projects, there R many parts that rely on network requests. I have to construct different cUrl for each of them, which is very tiring at this time! So I will continue to update the same cUrl function, which is convenient for myself and others!

## Tips

The early versions may be immature and will be mainly updated later! The version of PHP is also being updated, as is the network security aspect! This project will continue to be updated over time! If there is a problem, U can go to the "[Issues](https://github.com/BiliPrk/php_curl_func/issues)" of the project to stay.

## Words to Friends from PRC / 给来自中国的朋友的话

If U happen to be a friend from mainland PRC, and U don't have access to GitHub, which is blocked by the Chinese Gov, but U still want to get updates, then I think U may need some special means of accessing the Internet or go to [my Chinese blog](https://www.cprk.cc/) to download.

如果你恰好是中国大陆的朋友，而且你没有权限访问被中国政府封锁的 GitHub，但你仍然想获得更新，那么我认为你可能需要一些特殊的访问互联网的方式或是去[我的中文博客](https://www.cprk.cc/)下载。
